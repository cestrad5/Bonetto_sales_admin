This project is a tool for salesforce at Bonetto to easily take orders from the clients as they are visiting.

# About Bonetto:

Bonetto is a small manufacturer specializing in wooden products. They design and produce a range of products for party stores and variety shops, including four main categories: wall key holders, photo frames, coin banks, and seasonal items.

# The need:

Salesforce needs a solution that allows for the display of the product catalog while simultaneously facilitating order placement during client visits (sales presentations). Clients are already familiar with the products; they simply need to view product images to make their decisions on whether to place an order or not. Typically, the sales representative displays a PDF catalog on their mobile phone, flipping through pages and having to remember product references and quantities as the client selects items. After completing the visit, the sales representative sends the order to the production engineer via WhatsApp, manually entering the client's name, product names, and quantities for each item. Unfortunately, there are instances when the sales representative forgets to include certain products or makes errors in quantity, resulting in lost sales and a negative experience for the client.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
